# Grub seemed to stumble on non-gzip initrds. As far as I know, the
# kernel does the decompression, so I don't know why Grub would care
# other than perhaps performing sanity checks.
# It's entirely possible that something else was going on, so if Grub
# is happy with whatever is the default (Zstd, probably), just get rid
# of this.
